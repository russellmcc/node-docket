<p><em>minimalist documentation generator</em></p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/ghostfact/node-docket">github</a></p>

<p><em>docket</em> is a tool I created for myself which lets one easily extract 
github-flavored-markdown from source code.  It isn't particularly smart
and it doesn't try to do too much, but it's easy to use.  The simple idea 
is that you should put your documentation in the same place as your code.</p>

<p>The implementation is inspired and uses some code by <code>docco</code>.</p>

<h2>Sections</h2>

<p>To make a section of comments visible to <em>docket</em>, use a named header
bracketed with tildes(<code>~</code>).  for example, </p>

<pre><code>  //~demosection~
  // Blah!
</code></pre>

<p>would begin a section called <code>demosection</code> in javascript.  The section will
continue until there is a line that is not a comment (i.e., either code or whitespace).
In this case, the <code>demosection</code> would contain the text <code>" Blah"</code>.  The tilde can
be changed to any other symbol or pair of symbols via the <code>-b</code> command line option.</p>

<h4>Re-opening sections</h4>

<p>Sections can be re-opened at any time, that is if you, at a later point in the file,
added the line</p>

<pre><code>  //~demosection~
  // More blah!
</code></pre>

<p>Any comments after that line would be put in the same section as the first comment. <br />
<code>demosection</code> would now contain <code>" Blah!\n More blah!"</code></p>

<h4>Output sections</h4>

<p>Any sections whose name ends in <code>.out</code> will be output into docket's base directory,
that is the current directory or the directory specified with the <code>-d</code> command line option.
By default the output will be in html generated by interpretting the section text as markdown, 
but with the <code>-m</code> option you can output the raw markdown.  We use the same github-flavored-markdown
as docco.</p>

<h4>Verbatim sections</h4>

<p>sections whose name begins with <code>verbatim:</code> are special in that the rest of the file,
code and all, are added to the section.</p>

<p>Across several files, there are no guarentees about the order files are added to sections.
To ensure a particular ordering, use square brackets <code>[]</code> at the end of the section name.
e.g:</p>

<pre><code>  //~ordered[a]~
  // this happens first


  //~ordered[b]~
  // this happens second
</code></pre>

<p>The tokens inside the square brackets are sorted in lexicographic order.</p>

<p>While a section is open, any tilded identifiers become references to other sections.
after all the input files are parsed, the references are filled in with the text
of the referenced section.  For example,</p>

<pre><code>  //~containersection~
  //~subsection~

  //.. stuff goes here
  //~subsection~
  //info!
</code></pre>

<p>Would cause <code>~containersection~</code> to contain <code>"info!"</code>.  If the referenced section
is never defined, no replacement is made.  References can be nested arbitrarily
but behavior is undefined if there is a reference loop (i.e. a section references itself).</p>

<p><code>docket</code> is released under a permissive license, but it uses some code and ideas from
<code>docco</code>, which is under the MIT license.</p></td></tr></tbody>
