<p><em>minimalist documentation generator</em></p>

<p><em>docket</em> is a tool I created for myself which lets one easily extract 
 github-flavored-markdown from source code.  It isn't particularly smart
 and it doesn't try to do too much, but it's easy to use.  The simple idea 
 is that you should put your documentation in the same place as your code.</p>

<p>The implementation is inspired and uses some code by <code>docco</code>.</p>

<p>To make a section of comments visible to <em>docket</em>, use a named header
 bracketed with tildes(<code>~</code>).  for example, </p>

<pre><code>   //~demosection~
   // Blah!
</code></pre>

<p>would begin a section called <code>demosection</code> in javascript.  The section will
 continue until there is a line that is not a comment (i.e., either code or whitespace).
 In this case, the <code>demosection</code> would contain the text <code>" Blah"</code>.  The tilde can
 be changed to any other symbol or pair of symbols via the <code>-b</code> command line option.</p>

<p>Sections can be re-opened at any time, that is if you, at a later point in the file,
 added the line</p>

<pre><code>   //~demosection~
   // More blah!
</code></pre>

<p>Any comments after that line would be put in the same section as the first comment. <br />
 <code>demosection</code> would now contain <code>" Blah!\n More blah!"</code></p>

<p>Any sections whose name ends in <code>.out</code> will be output into docket's base directory,
 that is the current directory or the directory specified with the <code>-d</code> command line option.
 By default the output will be in html generated by interpretting the section text as markdown, 
 but with the <code>-m</code> option you can output the raw markdown.  We use the same github-flavored-markdown
 as docco.</p>

<p>While a section is open, any tilded identifiers become references to other sections.
 after all the input files are parsed, the references are filled in with the text
 of the referenced section.  For example,</p>

<pre><code>   //~containersection~
   //~subsection~

   //.. stuff goes here
   //~subsection~
   //info!
</code></pre>

<p>Would cause <code>~containersection~</code> to contain <code>"info!"</code>.  If the referenced section
 is never defined, no replacement is made.  References can be nested arbitrarily
 but behavior is undefined if there is a reference loop (i.e. a section references itself).</p>

<p><code>docket</code> is released under a permissive license, but it uses some code and ideas from
 <code>docco</code>, which is under the MIT license.</p></td></tr></tbody>
